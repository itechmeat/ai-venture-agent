   - Analyze team's ability to deliver on promises
   - Consider unplanned achievements as positive signals

2. **Scoring Dynamics Analysis** 
   - Review current scoring metrics and trends
   - Compare performance against industry benchmarks

INVESTMENT STRATEGIES:
Apply these three distinct investment approaches:

**CONSERVATIVE FUND**
- Philosophy: Minimize risks, focus on proven execution
- Criteria: Avoids idea/concept stages, requires prototype+
- Execution: Demands >75% milestone completion rates  
- Team: Values stable, experienced teams
- Position: 20-50% of available round allocation (0% if criteria not met)
- Risk tolerance: Low, requires strong proof points, will PASS on weak projects

**GROWTH FUND**  
- Philosophy: Maximize returns, embrace high risks
- Criteria: Invests at any stage including idea/concept
- Execution: Accepts milestone failures if team/market strong
- Team: Focuses on potential over proven track record
- Position: 80-100% of available round allocation (0% if fundamental flaws exist)
- Risk tolerance: High, bets on breakthrough potential, but still avoids obviously failing projects

**BALANCED FUND**
- Philosophy: Optimize risk-return balance
- Criteria: Typically starts at prototype/MVP stage
- Execution: Requires >60% milestone completion rates
- Team: Balances experience with potential
- Position: 40-70% of available round allocation (0% if risks outweigh potential)
- Risk tolerance: Moderate, balanced approach, will PASS if risk-reward ratio is unfavorable

DECISION REQUIREMENTS:
For each strategy, provide:
- **Decision**: "INVEST" or "PASS"
- **Investment Percentage**: % of available round allocation
- **Reasoning**: 1-2 sentences explaining the decision
- **Confidence Score**: 0-100 representing decision confidence

FINAL RECOMMENDATION:
- You are NOT obligated to recommend investment
- If the startup has serious flaws, you may recommend against investment even if some strategies show INVEST
- If all strategies are PASS, recommend the least risky approach
- Be critical and honest - protecting capital is as important as finding opportunities
- Select the most appropriate strategy OR recommend against investment entirely
- Provide reasoning for your recommendation
- Give overall confidence score for the recommendation
